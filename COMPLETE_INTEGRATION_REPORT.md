## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### TypeScript Errors in IDE

**Issue**: VS Code shows "Cannot find module 'react'" errors

**Cause**: Language server hasn't refreshed after npm install

**Solution**: 
```
Cmd+Shift+P → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
```

**Alternative**: Just ignore - code compiles fine

### Top Bar Not Hiding

**Issue**: Top bar doesn't auto-hide

**Cause**: User has it pinned

**Solution**: Click the pin icon to unpin

### Sidebar Won't Open

**Issue**: Sidebar doesn't appear when toggled

**Cause**: Might be in zen mode

**Solution**: Press ⌘+⇧+Z to exit zen mode

### Bubble Menu Not Showing

**Issue**: Bubble menu doesn't appear on text selection

**Cause**: Text selection might be empty or in a code block

**Solution**: Select actual text content (not in code blocks)
