After you've tested the new UI and verified everything works, you can safely delete these files:

### Component Files (7 files)

```bash
# Replace with new UI components

rm app/editor/_components/SlashMenu.tsx               # ‚Üí SlashCommandsEnhanced.tsx
```

**Review before deleting:**
```bash
# Check if Toolbar has unique features not in new components
# app/editor/_components/Toolbar.tsx
```

### Backup Files (1 file)

```bash
# After confirming new page works
rm app/editor/[id]/page-old-backup.tsx
```

### Example/Documentation Files (Optional)

```bash
# These were for reference during development

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

**DO NOT delete these files before:**
1. ‚úÖ Testing all UI features work
2. ‚úÖ Verifying all old features work
3. ‚úÖ Running in production for a few days
4. ‚úÖ Creating a git commit/backup

**Recommended**: Wait 1-2 weeks before deleting to ensure stability.

## üìä Space Savings

After cleanup:
- **~3,000 lines** of old code removed
- **~7 files** deleted
- **Cleaner codebase**
- **Easier maintenance**

---

## üéØ Verification Before Deletion

Run this checklist before deleting any files:

```bash
# 1. Search for imports of old files
grep -r "TopBarEnhanced" app/
grep -r "LeftSidebarEnhanced" app/
grep -r "InspectorEnhanced" app/
grep -r "FloatingToolbar" app/
grep -r "ContextMenu" app/
grep -r "SlashMenu" app/

# Should only find in page-old-backup.tsx
# If found elsewhere, update those files first
```

```bash
# 2. Test in production
# - Deploy to staging
# - Test all features
# - Monitor for errors
# - Get user feedback
```

```bash
# 3. Create backup
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before cleanup"
```

```bash
# 4. Then delete
# Run cleanup command above
```
