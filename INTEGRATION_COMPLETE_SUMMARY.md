## 🚀 How to Start Using It

### Immediate Use:

```bash
# Already done:
npm install  ✅

# Start dev server:
npm run dev
```

Then visit your editor and:
1. Scroll down → watch top bar hide
2. Press ⌘+\ → toggle sidebar
3. Select text → see bubble menu
4. Select component → see inspector slide in
5. Press ⌘+⇧+F → enter focus mode
6. Right-click → see enhanced menu
7. Type / → see command palette

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I see TypeScript errors in VS Code"

**Solution**: 
```
Cmd+Shift+P → TypeScript: Restart TS Server
```

The errors are false positives from the language server being confused after npm install.

### "Top bar not hiding"

**Check**:
1. Is `autoHideTopBar` enabled? (default: yes)
2. Is top bar pinned? (click pin icon to unpin)
3. Are you scrolling down past 50px?

### "Sidebar not showing"

**Check**:
1. Is `leftSidebarOpen` true? (press ⌘+\ to toggle)
2. Are you in zen mode? (press ⌘+⇧+Z to exit)
3. Check browser console for errors

### "Animations not working"

**Check**:
1. Does user have `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled?
2. Is `animationsEnabled` true in state?
3. Are you seeing any console errors?
